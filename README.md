As a first semester CS student at Punjab University, I am passionate about exploring the depths of computer science and software development. With a year of experience using Linux and a strong foundation in programming languages such as Python, C, and C++, I am constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to expand my knowledge.  

I am currently polishing my skills in web development, driven by a desire to create meaningful and impactful digital experiences.  
My ultimate goal is to leverage my technical expertise and creativity to make a positive impact on the world through innovative and transformative technological solutions.
